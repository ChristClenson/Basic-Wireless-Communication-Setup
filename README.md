# Basic Wireless Communication System

This repository contains the project details for the **"Basic Wireless Communication System"**, completed as part of the Semester 3 EN2130 Communication Design Project module. The project involves the design and implementation of a point-to-point digital wireless communication system using software-defined radios (SDRs).

## Project Overview

The wireless communication system utilizes:

- **Transmitter**: BladeRF 2.0 micro xA9
- **Receiver**: RTL-SDR

### Project Goals
The goal of the project was to transmit the following data types:
- Binary stream
- Image file
- Audio file

### Achievements
We successfully transmitted and received the **image** and **audio** files with high accuracy. The image and audio were processed and transmitted without significant issues, demonstrating the functionality of the system.

### Challenges
However, due to some technical difficulties, we were not able to correctly receive the transmitted **binary stream**. Despite this challenge, the project provided valuable insights into the complexities of SDRs and wireless communication.

## Key Features
- Point-to-point communication using SDR technology
- Successful transmission of image and audio files
- Hands-on experience with BladeRF 2.0 micro xA9 and RTL-SDR

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the practical application of digital communication concepts, signal processing techniques, and SDR technology. It highlights the importance of troubleshooting and refining complex systems, with the aim of further improving the reliability of data transmission in future work.
